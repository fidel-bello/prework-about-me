      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am learning how to code with UM Coding Bootcamp. These are some basic skills that I'm learning before I start classes. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Mexico but grew up in a small town called Canton, Mississippi.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are working out and going fishing.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to become a web developer and work at a company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Miami, FL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web developing has always caught my attention since an early age. Living in Mississippi all my life really did not give me much opportunity to really get deep into the subject. 
        But now in Miami I can hopefully fulfill my dream and help people reach their goals into developing and maintaining a business online.
